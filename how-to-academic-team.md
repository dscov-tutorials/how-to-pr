# Set up your Organization to use Academic Privileges

You can give your organization (and all its repositories) more powerful tools by upgrading them to a "Team" plan with GitHub Education.

- Sign up as a teacher on https://education.github.com. This may take several days and requires you to upload documentation to show you're a teacher.
- Once you are approved, visit https://education.github.com/globalcampus/teacher 
- Find the section "Upgrade your academic organizations"
- Click "Upgrade to GitHub Team"
- Select the organizations you would like to upgrade.
