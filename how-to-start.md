# Getting Started

You'll need:
- a GitHub account (get one here: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)).
- a way to clone and modify the repository on your machine:
  * either the [GitHub Desktop app](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop) (recommended) or
  * the [GitHub Command Line Tool `gh`](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation) *and* the [Git command line tool `git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- a text editor ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) is commonly used and a pretty good general text editor.)
