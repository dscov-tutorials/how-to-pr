# How to Review a Pull Request

- Click the "add your review" button![Screen Shot 2022-10-06 at 16 06 54](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2803227/194415498-678ad215-29c2-4754-8c26-f99ad4bd06dd.png)

- On the code page which appears, look through the changes, checking for everything which is important for your project, starting with overall intent and structure, then correctness, whether the code is tested, documentation, consistency with the rest of the codebase, style, etc.
- Add comments wherever you think they are needed or useful.
    - Hover over the line number you want to comment on, then click the "+" button which appears to start a comment.

    - Add a description or comment. 
    - It is sometimes easier for the PR's author if you include concrete suggestions:
    - Once your comment is done, click the "start a review" button.

> ## ⚠️ Important considerations around comments
> Please follow the usual rules of giving feedback:
> - Comment on the content, not the person who created it.
> - Use the personal pronoun in your feedback: “I think that…” or “I would change how this works in the following way: …” or “I think we understand this concept differently. I see it this way: …”
> - The PR and any comments or reviews on it **may be available on the web for ever**. Even if a repository is “Private” today, it may be made “Public” in the future, along with all of the PRs and the review comments.
