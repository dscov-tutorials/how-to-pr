# Make a Branch based on "main" where you'll solve the issue

> ## Definitions
> üí° A **branch** is a movable label attached to a particular commit. If you have a branch "checked-out", then when you make a new commit "on the branch", the branch is updated to point to the new commit. You'll make a series of commits, and then merge the final commit in that series (which *is* the "branch") back into "main". 
> 
> üí° The **default branch** is called **main**. The current most up-to-date version of the code, excluding any not-yet-merged pull requests, is the commit which the main branch points to.
> 
> üëµ *The default branch was formerly called "master," a term which has been replaced due to its association with slavery. Some Git documentation still uses the old term.*

There are several ways you can make a new branch.
- On the GitHub issue page (the easiest option) 
- In the GitHub Desktop App (the second easiest option)
- Using the Git command line tool (the most flexible option)

For all of the methods, you should follow these rules of branch and repository naming:
- `use-lower-case-with-dashes-separating-the-words`
- Choose a descriptive name, like `34-feat-update-history-section-formatting` or `42-fix-broken-links-in-introduction` to help others navigate the branches. 
 
 > ‚ö†Ô∏è Projects involving a few people might have tens of concurrent branches. Non-descriptive names like `test-branch1` or `final-update`, `final-update-2` make the task of remembering which branch is which overwhelming or impossible.

## On the GitHub issue page
Click "Create a branch" on the issue page.

A branch name will be suggested, and you can specify how you want to get access to the new branch.

If you click "Open branch with GitHub Desktop", you should automatically be prompted to open the GitHub Desktop App. (If you've not already downloaded the Repository, the Desktop app will handle that for you at this stage.)

If you click "Checkout locally" you'll be prompted to run some commands in your local copy of the repository.<img width="1110" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-05 at 15 53 02" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2803227/194150561-819ec255-6b2b-4d01-b30b-264df4f3c1a5.png">

The new branch will be created and you can start to make changes in your text editor.

## Using GitHub Desktop

Click on "Current Branch" and then "New Branch" <img width="1068" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-05 at 15 57 53" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2803227/194151554-1dbc056b-bb92-4bf3-8104-73f4de8ac31a.png">

If you currently have the main branch checked out, you'll be asked to name your new branch.
<img width="1112" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-05 at 16 02 01" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2803227/194152194-feb675e5-e41b-4604-89c2-ca060c28742c.png">

If you currently have a different branch checked out, you'll be asked to name your branch *and* choose to "Create branch based on..."
<img width="1112" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-05 at 15 59 45" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2803227/194152020-b049819a-cc5a-475d-8571-16f088fd2b07.png">

Here you should choose the "main" branch to base your new branch on.

The new branch will be created and you can start to make changes.

## Using `git` on the command line

### Create a new branch

If you are already on the branch where your changes need to be included ‚Äì in our example always the "main" branch, then you can run this command to switch to a new branch you **c**reate
```shell
git switch -c 34-fix-formatting
```
If you have a different branch currently checked out, then you can do the following:
```shell
git switch -c 34-fix-formatting main
```
... where `main` is the name of the "start-point," that is the commit where your new branch will begin.

### Use an existing branch from GitHub

If the branch you want to use is already on GitHub, then you can clone it and switch to it locally.

First ensure you have an up-to-date version of all the remote commits:
```shell
git fetch
```

Then, create and switch to the branch from the remote:
```shell
git switch 35-branch-on-github
```

Check which branch you're on by calling:
```shell
git status
```
