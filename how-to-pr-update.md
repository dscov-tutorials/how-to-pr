# How to update your Pull Request

Reasons you might want to update a pull request include:
- Addressing comments and requested changes
- The main branch has changed

These two cases are dealt with differently.

## Addressing comments and requested changes

Wait until you have the amount of feedback you need.

- If your PR is approved by everyone, congratulations!
- If not, and once you've got the feedback you want, then 
  - ðŸ›  fix any shortcomings on the *same branch*, [making new commits](), and then
  - push the updated branch using `git push` when you're done.
- **Important:** Ensure you re-request the review from your reviewers once you're finished with the updates.
