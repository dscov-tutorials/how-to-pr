# How to update your Pull Request

Reasons you might want to update a pull request include:
- Addressing comments and requested changes
- The main branch has changed

These two cases are dealt with differently.

## Addressing comments and requested changes

Wait until you have the amount of feedback you need.

- If your PR is approved by everyone, congratulations!
- If not, and once you've got the feedback you want, then 
  - ðŸ›  fix any shortcomings on the *same branch*, [making new commits](), and then
  - push the updated branch using `git push` when you're done.
- **Important:** Ensure you re-request the review from your reviewers once you're finished with the updates. <img width="327" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-06 at 17 56 46" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2803227/194426013-d5bcd4c8-2af2-4f74-8ebe-6b52c3f8b710.png">
