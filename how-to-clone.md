# Clone the repository, making a copy on your computer

You need[^1] to load the repository (and all its history) on your computer before you can begin to change it.

[^1]: You can modify individual files on GitHub directly, using the built-in editor. However, most of the time, you'll want to do this on a computer.

## Using GitHub Desktop

- Navigate to the repository page on GitHub.
- Press the "Code" button
‚õîÔ∏èTODO Code Button

- Press the "Open with GitHub Desktop" Button
- Follow the prompts on screen

## Using the GitHub Command Line Tool `gh`

Login to GitHub by calling:
```bash
gh auth login
```

- At the prompts, select:
    - "? What account do you want to log into?" `GitHub.com`
    - "? What is your preferred protocol for Git operations?" `HTTPS`
    - "? Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials?" `Y`
    - "? How would you like to authenticate GitHub CLI?" `Login with a web browser`

- At the prompt "! First copy your one-time code:" copy your one-time code which looks like `AB12-34CD`.
- Open a new tab in your web browser and navigate to [https://github.com/login/device](https://github.com/login/device). (Your browser may open automatically.)
- There, paste the one-time code.
- On the next page, select `Authorize github`.
- Follow any other prompts to complete your login.

> üí° We no longer recommend using self-generated public keys (like `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) to authenticate on GitHub. The modern authentication schemes using tokens, and incorporating 2FA, are more secure, especially in shared systems like Oscar. `gh` uses these tokens.

- Navigate to the repository page on GitHub.
- Press the "Code" button
‚õîÔ∏èTODO Code Button
- Select GitHub CLI
- Copy the command, which will look like this: `gh repo clone dscov-tutorials/how-to-pr`

- In your terminal, find an an unsynced directory (*i.e.* a directory not synced using Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud, OneDrive, Seafile...[^2])
- Run the command in your terminal:
  ```shell
  gh repo clone dscov-tutorials/how-to-pr
  ```

[^2]: File synchronization tools like Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud, OneDrive, Seafile don't do things the same way as `git`, and they can interfere with each other.
